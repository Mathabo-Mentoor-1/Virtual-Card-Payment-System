### **Justification for Generic Repository with Entity-Specific Interfaces**

**1. Promotes Reusability and DRY Principle**
- Creating a generic repository interface encapsulates common CRUD operations that many entities (like VirtualCard, Transaction, UserAccount, etc.) will share. This avoids duplicating the same code logic across different parts of the system.
<br>

**2. Supports Clean Architecture**
- The interface-based approach allows you to decouple business logic from the data access logic. This aligns with clean architecture, where use cases donâ€™t depend on frameworks or infrastructure.

<br>

**3. Enables Testability**
- By depending on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, it's easier to mock or stub repositories during testing. For example, in unit tests you could mock IVirtualCardRepository to test the business logic in isolation.

<br>

**4. Encourages Specificity with Flexibility**
- While the base repository handles generic CRUD, entity-specific repositories can extend it and add domain-specific methods. 

<br>

**5. Adheres to Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- This approach ensures that clients (services, use cases) only depend on methods they use. Instead of bloated repositories, each interface is fine-tuned to the entity it handles.

<br>

**6. Supports Swappable Implementations**
- Want to switch from a SQL database to NoSQL or in-memory store? As long as the new implementation adheres to the interface, the core system doesn't need to change
