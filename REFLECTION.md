| 1          | Good introductory assignment. The exposure to new platforms is both tricky and good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2          | I struggled with this assignment. Having to learn how to use a new coding language while having to deliver an assignment is both frustrating and confusing. I'm hoping the upcoming assignments will be better. I ended up not submitting anything for this assignment, which I regret but just prof would say, just move on to the next assignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3          | By Far the most straight forward and simple assignment thus far. I really enjoyed coming up with the project I will be building with series of assignments to follow after.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4          | The topicis covered for in order to deliver this assignment allow to understand my project in depth and opened up my mind to consider different factors thatâ€™s contribute to it. Good learning experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5          | I think with each assignment wee are granted the opportunity to understand our projects better. You are able to note where you missed the mark and how to go about correcting it. I won't lie ensuring that you consider most if not all of the requirements of your project was a bit difficult, simply because there's a lot that goes into the type of project that I have chosen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6          | I was confused as to how I must use the Github project tools for my User Stories because the deliverable under each section of this assignment reflected a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7          | I had to watch a Youtube video inorder for me to ensure that I navigate through Github and create a project then a kanban board. I did however struggle to add the extra 2 required columns on to the board. I got an error message for the first 3 attempts -I'm not sure if whether it was the network or what, but eventually when I trie dthe 4th time I was able to. I would say that Github is much more simple and more user friendly than the other tools and the fact that it is integrated within itself and free is even better. The only issue with the Github Kanban Board is the customization limitation. Basically - GitHub Kanban is best for teams already using GitHub and looking for a lightweight, integrat          |
| 8          | I struggled quite a bit with the Activity diagrams more specifically with the mermaid code aspect of of it. My codes just didn't run and was very stressful because the diagrams weigh a huge chunk of this assignment. All in all each and every assignment is a learning experience. the assignment s paint a picture of the thoery and make it easier to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
