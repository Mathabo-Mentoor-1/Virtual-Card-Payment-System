| 1          | Good introductory assignment. The exposure to new platforms is both tricky and good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2          | I struggled with this assignment. Having to learn how to use a new coding language while having to deliver an assignment is both frustrating and confusing. I'm hoping the upcoming assignments will be better. I ended up not submitting anything for this assignment, which I regret but just prof would say, just move on to the next assignment.                                  |
| 3          | By Far the most straight forward and simple assignment thus far. I really enjoyed coming up with the project I will be building with series of assignments to follow after.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4          | The topicis covered for in order to deliver this assignment allow to understand my project in depth and opened up my mind to consider different factors thatâ€™s contribute to it. Good learning experience                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5          | I think with each assignment wee are granted the opportunity to understand our projects better. You are able to note where you missed the mark and how to go about correcting it. I won't lie ensuring that you consider most if not all of the requirements of your project was a bit difficult, simply because there's a lot that goes into the type of project that I have chosen. |
| 6          | I was confused as to how I must use the Github project tools for my User Stories because the deliverable under each section of this assignment reflected a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
