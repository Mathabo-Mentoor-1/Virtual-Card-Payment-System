**Reflection**
I feel like we do not get enouigh time to fully grasp and understand the concepts covered in each topic because we are literally taught the topic on Thursday and the assigment is given the week before we even cover it then we must submit 2 days after being taught the topic. It also feels very overwhelming because one doesn't have the opportunity to fully understand the topic inorder to carry out the assignment in the manner in which we are supposed. Everything feels rushed,personally I would've preffered the normal way of doing assignments instead of every week. I end spending most of my weekend doing Software Engineering and not having enough time to study my other modules. It's only been a month and I am already exhausted!! Studying while working is already tricky as it is and we bank on weekends for studying and assignments but now we barely have room to breathe in between nor have time to cover enough to fully understand the curriculum.
