| 1          | Good introductory assignment. The exposure to new platforms is both tricky and good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2          | I struggled with this assignment. Having to learn how to use a new coding language while having to deliver an assignment is both frustrating and confusing. I'm hoping the upcoming assignments will be better. I ended up not submitting anything for this assignment, which I regret but just prof would say, just move on to the next assignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3          | By Far the most straight forward and simple assignment thus far. I really enjoyed coming up with the project I will be building with series of assignments to follow after.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4          | The topicis covered for in order to deliver this assignment allow to understand my project in depth and opened up my mind to consider different factors that’s contribute to it. Good learning experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5          | I think with each assignment wee are granted the opportunity to understand our projects better. You are able to note where you missed the mark and how to go about correcting it. I won't lie ensuring that you consider most if not all of the requirements of your project was a bit difficult, simply because there's a lot that goes into the type of project that I have chosen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6          | I was confused as to how I must use the Github project tools for my User Stories because the deliverable under each section of this assignment reflected a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7          | I had to watch a Youtube video inorder for me to ensure that I navigate through Github and create a project then a kanban board. I did however struggle to add the extra 2 required columns on to the board. I got an error message for the first 3 attempts -I'm not sure if whether it was the network or what, but eventually when I trie dthe 4th time I was able to. I would say that Github is much more simple and more user friendly than the other tools and the fact that it is integrated within itself and free is even better. The only issue with the Github Kanban Board is the customization limitation. Basically - GitHub Kanban is best for teams already using GitHub and looking for a lightweight, integrat          |
| 8          | I struggled quite a bit with the Activity diagrams more specifically with the mermaid code aspect of of it. My codes just didn't run and was very stressful because the diagrams weigh a huge chunk of this assignment. All in all each and every assignment is a learning experience. the assignment s paint a picture of the thoery and make it easier to understand.                                                                                     |
| 9          | Designing the domain model and class diagram for a virtual-card payment system presented several challenges that required careful consideration of object-oriented design principles, system requirements, and trade-offs between simplicity and extensibility. The process involved translating abstract business needs and user interactions into tangible software structures, which was both intellectually rewarding and technically complex. One of the main challenges was identifying and defining the key entities in the system, such as `User`, `VirtualCard`, `Transaction`, and `PaymentGateway`. These classes had to capture real-world behaviors while remaining decoupled and flexible. Initially, there was confusion about where to place certain responsibilities—should the `Transaction` validate itself, or should the `VirtualCard` manage its own limits? This required iterating over the model several times to ensure clear responsibility assignment and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle. Aligning the class diagram with use cases, state diagrams, and system requirements was another layer of complexity. For instance, one use case required users to temporarily lock their cards. This led to the introduction of card states (e.g., active, locked, expired) and a state diagram that helped define transitions between these states. The class diagram had to reflect this behavior using state-related attributes and possibly a `CardState` pattern or enumeration. Ensuring consistency across these artifacts was crucial to validate that the design met functional expectations.Trade-offs were inevitable. One such decision involved the use of inheritance versus composition. Initially, there was an idea to use a base class `Card` with subclasses like `VirtualCard` and `PhysicalCard` (for future extensibility). However, since the current scope focused solely on virtual cards, this introduced unnecessary complexity. I chose to simplify the model by designing `VirtualCard` as a standalone class and favoring composition—for example, associating `VirtualCard` with behavior-specific components like `SecuritySettings` or `CardUsagePolicy`, instead of using subclassing. This approach adhered more closely to the principle of “favor composition over inheritance” and allowed for easier future modifications. Another trade-off involved database representation vs. object-oriented design purity. Some domain classes, like `Transaction`, needed to represent both historical and real-time data. To keep the model clean, a separate `TransactionHistory` repository was considered but ultimately postponed for future implementation to reduce scope creep.The process taught several lessons about object-oriented design. First, it reinforced the importance of starting with real-world scenarios and use cases before jumping into code or diagrams. The domain model was most effective when it reflected actual user interactions and business rules. Second, the experience highlighted the value of iterative design—models evolved as our understanding deepened. Finally, maintaining alignment between various UML diagrams (use case, state, class) ensured cohesion and reduced the risk of overlooked requirements.In conclusion, designing the class diagram for a virtual-card payment system was a balancing act between technical precision and practical constraints. It offered a valuable opportunity to apply core object-oriented principles in a real-world context and underscored the need for adaptability, clarity, and user-centric thinking in software architecture.         |
