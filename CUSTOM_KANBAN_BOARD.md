#### 1\. **Backlog**

*   **Purpose**: The "Backlog" column holds tasks that need to be worked on but haven't been prioritized for the current sprint or iteration yet.
    
*   **Customization**: For a Virtual-Card Payment System, the tasks here may include feature requests, new enhancements (e.g., integrating with new payment gateways or adding new security features), technical debt (e.g., refactoring code), or ideas for improving user experience.
    
*   **Why Important**: This column is crucial for long-term planning and helps ensure that potential features or improvements don't get lost in the shuffle.
    

#### 2\. **To Do**

*   **Purpose**: The "To Do" column is where you place tasks that have been prioritized and are ready to be worked on next. These tasks are typically scoped, assigned to team members, and scheduled for completion.
    
*   **Customization**: In a Virtual-Card Payment System, tasks in this column could be specific actions like:
    
    *   Setting up a new payment gateway integration.
        
    *   Developing user authentication features.
        
    *   Implementing fraud detection mechanisms.
        
    *   Designing and testing the user interface (UI) for virtual card creation.
        
*   **Why Important**: This column is the starting point for tasks that are ready for immediate work. It gives a clear sense of what will be tackled in the short term.
    

#### 3\. **In Progress**

*   **Purpose**: The "In Progress" column is where tasks go when they are actively being worked on.
    
*   **Customization**: For a Virtual-Card Payment System, tasks in this column could include:
    
    *   Coding or configuring payment flow.
        
    *   Building or integrating APIs (e.g., for issuing virtual cards or processing payments).
        
    *   Developing features for card security (e.g., tokenization, encryption).
        
    *   UI/UX development for card management screens.
        
*   **Why Important**: This column helps track which tasks are currently being worked on, providing visibility to the team about the active work.
    

#### 4\. **Testing**

*   **Purpose**: The "Testing" column holds tasks that are complete from a development perspective but need testing to ensure they work as expected before they are marked as finished.
    
*   **Customization**: For a Virtual-Card Payment System, testing might include:
    
    *   Unit testing for individual components (like payment gateway APIs or card generation).
        
    *   Integration testing to ensure the payment system works with external services (like issuing virtual cards through third-party providers).
        
    *   User acceptance testing (UAT) for features like card creation, payment processing, or transaction history.
        
    *   Security testing (e.g., checking for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, or testing compliance with PCI DSS standards).
        
*   **Why Important**: This column ensures that any new functionality is rigorously tested before it is marked complete, ensuring the reliability and security of the payment system.
    

#### 5\. **Done**

*   **Purpose**: The "Done" column represents tasks that have been completed successfully and require no further action.
    
*   **Customization**: For a Virtual-Card Payment System, tasks in this column could be:
    
    *   Fully integrated payment features, ready for use.
        
    *   User management systems that allow for virtual card creation and transaction history viewing.
        
    *   Card security features like encryption or fraud detection algorithms that have been implemented and verified.
