| 1   | Require Pull Request Reviews       | \> Enforces code review by at least one team member<br>\> Catches bugs, security issues, or bad practices before code is merged.<br>\> Encourages knowledge sharing across the team<br>\> Encourages knowledge sharing across the team<br>\> Adds a human layer of quality control. | \> Reduces the risk of bad code reaching your main branch and improves team collaboration.                                         |
| 2   | Require Status Checks to Pass (CI) | \> Verifies that the code builds, passes tests, and meets quality standards.<br>\> Ensures that each pull request is functional and doesnâ€™t break the app.<br>\> Prevents broken or untested code from being merged.                                                                | \> Maintains a stable codebase and increases confidence in automated deployments.                                                  |
| 3   | Disable Direct Pushes              | \> Prevents bypassing the rules (no one can sneak in unreviewed, untested code).<br>\> Enforces a PR-based workflow, which is easier to audit and track.<br>\> Keeps a clean, auditable history of changes.                                                                         | \> Forces all changes to go through the same quality checks and documentation process, increasing accountability and traceability. |
