Project Title: Virtual-Card Payment System
Domain: Public Transport Sector
Problem Statement:

**Current System**
- The MyCiti Bus currently uses a card-based payment system (myconnect card) that allows you to load money in advance for travelling.To get the myconnect get you must go to a MyCiti station kiosk or participating retailers.
- The myconnect card must be loaded at the station kiosks, retailers or Absa cash-accepting ATMs to get going
- The myconnect card is a bank card that has an expiry date just like a normal bank card.
- MyCiti has a free phone application that helps you plan your travel around Cape Town, access live updates to track the arrival time of your bus and allows you to conveniently save your favourite routes, stops and destinations for quick and easy access.


**System Improvement**
- With technology emerging and everything being easily accessible at the tip of our hands through our cellphones, moving from a card-based system to a virtual-card payment system would provide the following advantages:

1. **Digital-Only Card**: A virtual card is created and stored digitally, often via a mobile app or a web portal.

2. **Transaction Process**: Payments are made online by entering the virtual card's details (card number, expiration date, and security code) when completing an online transaction.

3. **Enhanced Security**: Virtual cards are often more secure than physical ones because they are typically single-use or have short expiration dates. This reduces the risk of fraud, as the card number isn't exposed during transactions.

4. **Reduced Risk of Loss or Theft**: Since virtual cards are only accessible digitally and not physically, they can't be lost or stolen in the traditional sense. If your virtual card number is compromised, you can simply generate a new one.

5. **Quick Set-Up**: You can instantly create a virtual card from your banking app or card issuer, so there's no need to wait for a physical card to arrive in the mail.

6. **Environmental Impact**: Choosing a virtual card means fewer physical materials used (such as plastic), which can be better for the environment.
