**Kanband Board**
<br>
<br>
**Definition of Kanban Board:**
<br>
- A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work.
<br>
<br>
**Explanation of my board:**
<br>
<br>
1. Visualizing Workflow
- In a virtual-card payment system, the Kanban board would typically represent the various stages of the payment process, from initiation to final approval or rejection. The stages on the board can be categorized into columns that represent the flow of tasks (payments) as they progress through the system. Here's an example of how this might look:
<br>
1.Backlog: Payment requests waiting to be processed.
2.To-Do: Payments that are ready for processing but haven't been started yet.
3.In Progress: Payments currently being processed, e.g., validating the virtual card details, checking balances, fraud checks, etc.
4.Ready for Approval: Payments that are complete and are awaiting approval from higher-ups or automated checks.
5.Completed: Payments that have been fully processed, approved, and settled.
  <br>
- This visualization allows team members to quickly see the status of each payment request, identify bottlenecks, and ensure nothing is overlooked. It fosters transparency and helps prioritize tasks by their stage in the workflow.
<br>
<br>
2. Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)
-A key principle in Kanban is limiting work-in-progress (WIP). By setting WIP limits on each column (or stage) of the workflow, the system ensures that no one is overwhelmed with too many tasks at once, which can reduce quality and efficiency. In the context of a virtual-card payment system, WIP limits might be applied to columns like "In Progress" or "Ready for Approval."
<br>
<br>
For example:
1.In Progress: You might set a WIP limit of 5, meaning no more than five payments can be processed at the same time. Once the team finishes one, another payment request can move into that stage.
2.Ready for Approval: The approval stage might also have a WIP limit to ensure that the approval team isn't overwhelmed.
3.By limiting the number of items in each stage, the team can focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, which prevents bottlenecks and enhances the flow of payments through the system. It also helps identify where delays or issues are occurring and where intervention is needed.

<br>
3. Supporting Agile Principles
- The Agile Manifesto emphasizes values like customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software frequently. A Kanban board directly supports these principles by:
<br>
1.Visualizing Flow: Teams can respond quickly to changes and customer needs by visualizing the workflow and making adjustments to priorities as needed. For example, if a priority payment request comes in, it can be moved quickly to the "In Progress" column, ensuring it gets processed promptly.
2.Fostering Collaboration: The Kanban board creates a shared understanding of the system's progress, enabling better communication and collaboration across team members. Developers, analysts, and approvers can easily see what tasks are coming up, what's in progress, and what needs attention.
3.Continuous Delivery: By visualizing the process and limiting WIP, the system encourages incremental delivery. This ensures that payments are processed frequently and in smaller, manageable chunks, allowing the system to adapt to changes more fluidly.
4.Improvement: Kanban emphasizes the continuous improvement of processes. By regularly reviewing the board and the workflow, the team can identify bottlenecks, refine processes, and make adjustments to improve the efficiency of the virtual-card payment system.
