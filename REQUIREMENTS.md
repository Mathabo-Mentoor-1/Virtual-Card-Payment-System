**Functional Requirements**

**1. Card Issuance and Management:**
- The system should allow users to generate virtual cards for payments, either automatically or on-demand.
- Users must be able to manage virtual cards, including activating, deactivating, and updating card details (e.g., expiry date, transaction limits).

**2. Payment Authorization and Authentication:**
- The system must authenticate users before issuing payments and support secure payment protocols, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), to ensure the legitimacy of the user.
- It should support real-time authorization for virtual card transactions to prevent fraud.

**3. Transaction History and Reporting:**
- The system should provide a detailed transaction history, including transaction amount, merchant, date, and status, accessible by the user.
- Users should have the ability to filter and export transaction reports for financial tracking and audits.

**4. Limit and Budget Management:**
- The system should allow users to set daily, monthly, or per-transaction limits on virtual cards to control spending.
- Users should be able to define budgets for different categories (e.g., shopping, subscriptions) for easier expense management.

**5. Integration with Merchant Payment Gateways:**
- The virtual card system must be compatible with major payment gateways and merchants (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express) to enable seamless transactions across different platforms.

**6. Fraud Detection and Prevention:**
- The system should have automated fraud detection mechanisms to identify unusual patterns and prevent unauthorized transactions, such as alerts for unusual spending or geolocation mismatches.
- It must block or flag transactions that appear suspicious or do not meet predefined security criteria.

**7. Real-Time Notifications:**
- Users should receive real-time notifications for all transactions made with the virtual card, including transaction success, failure, and any security alerts.
- Notifications should be customizable, such as via email, SMS, or push notification.

**8. Card Expiry and Renewal:**
- Virtual cards should have an expiration date, and users must be able to renew or replace their cards when expired or compromised, maintaining continuous access to payments.

**9. Refunds and Dispute Management:**
- The system should support handling refunds for virtual card transactions, including initiating disputes with merchants or financial institutions if there is an issue with a payment.
- Users should be able to view the status of disputes and refunds in real-time.
  
**10. Cross-Platform Support:**
- The system should provide an API or application for users to access virtual cards from various platforms, such as web, mobile apps, or integrations with other financial tools.
- The virtual card system should be compatible with both Android and iOS platforms for mobile use.



**Non-Functional Requirements**

**1. Usability**
- User Interface (UI) Consistency: The system must provide a consistent and intuitive user interface across different devices and platforms, ensuring ease of use for all user levels (novice to expert).
- Accessibility: The system should be accessible to users with disabilities by adhering to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
- Multi-language Support: The system must support multiple languages and regions, enabling users to operate in their preferred language.
- Response Time: The user interface should respond within 2 seconds for any user action, providing a smooth and frictionless experience.
- Error Handling: The system should offer clear and concise error messages, with actionable suggestions for resolution.

**2. Deployable**
- Continuous Deployment: The system should support continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment, ensuring faster updates and bug fixes.
- Environment Compatibility: The system must be deployable across various environments (production, staging, development), and support multiple platforms such as cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- Containerization: The system should support containerized deployments using tools like Docker or Kubernetes for easier scalability, portability, and environment isolation.
- Rollback Capability: The deployment process must include the ability to rollback to a previous stable version of the system in case of a failure or bug in the latest release.

**3. Maintainability**
- Code Modularity: The system should be designed in a modular way so that individual components (e.g., payment gateway, user authentication) can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.
- Automated Testing: The system should include automated unit, integration, and system tests to ensure ongoing stability and help in detecting issues early.
- Clear Documentation: All system components, configurations, and deployment processes should be thoroughly documented, including developer and user manuals.
- Error Logging: The system must include detailed logging and monitoring to track any issues, user actions, or errors. Logs should be easily accessible for troubleshooting.
- Versioning: The system should maintain version control for both the codebase and deployed infrastructure, making it easy to manage different versions over time.

**4. Scalability**
- Horizontal Scaling: The system must support horizontal scaling (adding more servers or instances) to accommodate increased traffic and growing user demand.
- Load Balancing: The system should include load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance.
- Database Scaling: The systemâ€™s database should support vertical and horizontal scaling, enabling it to handle increased data volume and transactions without performance degradation.
- Auto-Scaling: The system should support auto-scaling based on predefined thresholds, automatically adjusting resources based on demand fluctuations.

**5. Security**
- Data Encryption: All sensitive data, including payment information and user credentials, should be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES, TLS 1.2/1.3).
- Authentication and Authorization: The system must implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication, OAuth) and role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized access.
- Compliance: The system must comply with relevant regulations and standards such as PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
- Audit Logging: The system should maintain comprehensive audit logs for all user activities, particularly transactions, and be able to track any unauthorized or suspicious actions.
- Penetration Testing: The system should be regularly tested for vulnerabilities through penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

**6. Performance**
- Response Time: The system should process all payment transactions in less than 2 seconds, with a 99.99% success rate for transactions.
- Throughput: The system should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent transactions (e.g., thousands of transactions per second) without performance degradation.
- Latency: The payment processing latency should be kept below a maximum threshold (e.g., 1 second) for both authorization and settlement operations.
- Load Testing: The system should be regularly load-tested to ensure that it can handle spikes in usage without a drop in performance.
