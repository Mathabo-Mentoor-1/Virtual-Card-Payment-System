**VIRTUAL-CARD PAYMENT SYSTEM**

Project Title: Virtual-Card Payment System

Description: 
- This system will be an improvement to an existing process of loading money on to the MyCiti "myconnect" transport card.
- Currently the process uses a card-based payment system to load money to travel for a week, month, or more.
- Inorder to get the myconnect card you must go to a MyCiTi station kiosks or participating retailers and purchase the card for R40.00, the same process applies when wanting to load your card with money.
- The improvement that I would like to implement is moving from a card-based system to a virtual-card system.

  
Once implemented the virtual-card system will achieve the below:
- A virtual card that will be created and stored digitally,on the MyCiti mobile app.
- An easy transaction process for the user to load money on to their myconnect card which is accessible at anytime
- Since virtual cards are only accessible digitally and not physically, they can't be lost or stolen in the traditional sense. If your virtual card number is compromised, you can simply generate a new one.
